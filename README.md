# guess_the_number
JavaScript project to understand DOM manipulation
A simple game where an unknown number picked at random is stored in the memory and the player has to find the number by guessing. A score is maintained starting with a particular score and for every wrong guess the score goes down by 1. The game should also specify if the guess is higher or lower than the stored number with further hints as the player gets close to the stored number.
